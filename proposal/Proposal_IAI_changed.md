# SkAI - Project Proposal

Skateboard Brand Identifier

### Project Description

After skateboarding made its debut at Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games, the skateboarding industry is becoming a promising industry and it will attract more and more young people all over the world to play this sport. Skateboard brands are a major aspect of the skateboarding industry and what it means to be a part of the culture. These brands use skateboard decks to show their personalities and differentiate from each other. But for newbies or people who know nothing about skateboarding, it's hard to get to know the skateboarding brand from a photo of a skateboarding deck. For this, we're going to use AI to help rookie to get the brand name from their uploaded deck images. To be specific, users can upload an image or photo of the skateboarding deck to our system, then the system will tell you which brand of this deck.

### Data sources

We are considering collecting deck images from e-commerce websites or brands' official websites manually. There're tons of brands in this industry, we are trying to focus on some of them, like Zero, Death Wish, PlanB, and Santa Cruz. 100 images for each brand.
